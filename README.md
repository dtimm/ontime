#OnTime
OnTime is a command-line app for time nerds.

The ultimate goal is an app and a library for converting between various
arbitrary time and date standards. Do you like your dates in the hebrew
calendar and your time in metric/French revolutionary time? You should be able
to get that as output with a single command.

Want to know when Halley's Comet will be back on the Mayan long-count calendar?
It's a breeze!
